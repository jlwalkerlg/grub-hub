Important note: if the database doesn't already exist, it will be initialised when running `docker-compose up` with `schema.sql`, but this causes a slight delay before the database is ready and as such causes the docker web service to fail because it can't connect to the database. At the time of writing, the work-around is to make sure the database is ready or run the db project first to give it chance to initialise the database. E.g. `docker-compose up -d db`, followed by `docker-compose up -d` after a short delay.
